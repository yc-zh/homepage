						I am a Research Scientist at Facebook AI Research (FAIR). My research areas include computer vision and deep learning.
						<br><br>
												
						I have published some highly influential papers in computer vision and deep learning.
						My paper on Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) is the most cited paper in all research areas in Google Scholar Metrics 2019, 2020, 2021.
						The residual connection is a fundamental component in modern deep learning models (e.g., Transformers, AlphaGo Zero).
						My works on object detection and segmentation, including Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN, have made significant impact and are among the most cited papers in these areas.
						In recent years, I have been interested in unsupervised learning and my explorative works are the top cited papers published in CVPR 2020, 2021, 2022.
						I have a couple of papers that are among the top-10 most cited papers published in top-tier conferences for each year.
						My publications have 330,000 citations (as of July 2022) with an increase of ~100,000 per year.
						<br><br>

						I am a recipient of several prestigious awards in computer vision, including the PAMI Young Researcher Award in 2018, the Best Paper Award in CVPR 2009, CVPR 2016, ICCV 2017, the Best Student Paper Award in ICCV 2017, the Best Paper Honorable Mention in ECCV 2018, CVPR 2021, and the Everingham Prize in ICCV 2021.

						Before joining FAIR in 2016, I was with Microsoft Research Asia from 2011 to 2016. I received my PhD degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2011, and my BS degree from Tsinghua University in 2007.
