						I am an undergraduate of the School of Informatics of Xiamen University. My research areas include computer vision and deep learning.
						<br><br>
												
						I have published some highly influential papers in computer vision and deep learning.
						My paper on Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) is the most cited paper in all research areas in Google Scholar Metrics 2019, 2020, 2021.
						The residual connection is a fundamental component in modern deep learning models (e.g., Transformers, AlphaGo Zero).
						My works on object detection and segmentation, including Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN, have made significant impact and are among the most cited papers in these areas.
						In recent years, I have been interested in unsupervised learning and my explorative works are the top cited papers published in CVPR 2020, 2021, 2022.
						I have a couple of papers that are among the top-10 most cited papers published in top-tier conferences for each year.
						My publications have 330,000 citations (as of July 2022) with an increase of ~100,000 per year.
